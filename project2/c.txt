<s> he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were
in the land of egypt and laid up the food in the cities

joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea very much
until he stopped counting for it was without number </s> <s>
to joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came
whom asenath the daughter of potiphera priest of on
bore to him </s> <s>
joseph called the name of the firstborn manasseh for he said god has
made me forget all my toil and all my father's house </s> <s>
the name of the second he called ephraim for god has
made me fruitful in the land of my affliction </s> <s>
the seven years of plenty that were in the land of egypt
came to an end </s> <s>
the seven years of famine began to come just as joseph had said </s> <s>
there was famine in all lands but in all the land of egypt
there was bread </s> <s>
when all the land of egypt was famished the people cried to pharaoh
for bread and pharaoh said to all the egyptians go to joseph </s> <s>
what he says to you do </s> <s>
the famine was over all the surface of the earth </s> <s>
joseph opened all the store houses and sold to the egyptians </s> <s>
the famine was severe in the land of egypt </s> <s>
all countries came into egypt to joseph to buy grain
because the famine was severe in all the earth </s> <s>
now jacob saw that there was grain in egypt and jacob said
to his sons why do you look at one another </s> <s>
he said behold i have heard that there is grain in egypt </s> <s>
go down there and buy for us from there so that we may live
and not die </s> <s>
joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain from egypt </s> <s>
but jacob didn't send benjamin joseph's brother with his brothers
for he said lest perhaps harm happen to him </s> <s>
the sons of israel came to buy among those who came
for the famine was in the land of canaan </s> <s>
joseph was the governor over the land </s> <s>  it was he who sold
to all the people of the land </s> <s>  joseph's brothers came
and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth </s> <s>
joseph saw his brothers and he recognized them but acted
like a stranger to them and spoke roughly with them </s> <s>
he said to them where did you come from </s> <s>  they said
from the land of canaan to buy food </s> <s>
joseph recognized his brothers but they didn't recognize him </s> <s>
joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them
and said to them you are spies </s> <s>  you have come to see
the nakedness of the land </s> <s>
they said to him no my lord but your servants have come
to buy food </s> <s>
we are all one man's sons we are honest men </s> <s>  your servants
are not spies </s> <s>
he said to them no but you have come to see the nakedness
of the land </s> <s>
they said we your servants are twelve brothers the sons
of one man in the land of canaan and behold the youngest
is this day with our father and one is no more </s> <s>
joseph said to them it is like i told you saying 'you are spies.' </s> <s>
by this you shall be tested </s> <s>  by the life of pharaoh
you shall not go forth from here unless your youngest
brother comes here </s> <s>
send one of you and let him get your brother and you shall be bound
that your words may be tested whether there is truth in you
or else by the life of pharaoh surely you are spies </s> <s>
he put them all together into custody for three days </s> <s>
joseph said to them the third day do this and live
for i fear god </s> <s>
if you are honest men then let one of your brothers be bound
in your prison but you go carry grain for the famine
of your houses </s> <s>
bring your youngest brother to me so will your words be verified
and you won't die </s> <s>  they did so </s> <s>
they said one to another we are certainly guilty concerning
our brother in that we saw the distress of his soul
when he begged us and we wouldn't listen </s> <s>  therefore this
distress has come upon us </s> <s>
reuben answered them saying didn't i tell you saying
'don't sin against the child' and you wouldn't listen </s> <s>
therefore also behold his blood is required </s> <s>
they didn't know that joseph understood them for there was
an interpreter between them </s> <s>
he turned himself away from them and wept </s> <s>  then he returned
to them and spoke to them and took simeon from among them
and bound him before their eyes </s> <s>
then joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain
and to restore every man's money into his sack and to give
them food for the way </s> <s>  so it was done to them </s> <s>
they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed from there </s> <s>
as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the
lodging place he saw his money </s> <s>  behold it was in the mouth
of his sack </s> <s>
he said to his brothers my money is restored </s> <s>  behold it is
in my sack </s> <s>  their hearts failed them and they turned
trembling one to another saying what is this that god has
done to us </s> <s>
they came to jacob their father to the land of canaan
and told him all that had happened to them saying
the man the lord of the land spoke roughly with us
and took us for spies of the country </s> <s>
we said to him 'we are honest men </s> <s>  we are no spies </s> <s>
we are twelve brothers sons of our father one is no more
and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of canaan.' </s> <s>
the man the lord of the land said to us 'by this i will know
that you are honest men  leave one of your brothers with me
and take grain for the famine of your houses and go your way </s> <s>
bring your youngest brother to me </s> <s>  then i will know
that you are not spies but that you are honest men </s> <s>
so i will deliver your brother to you and you shall trade
in the land.' </s> <s>
it happened as they emptied their sacks that behold every man's
bundle of money was in his sack </s> <s>  when they and their father
saw their bundles of money they were afraid </s> <s>
jacob their father said to them you have bereaved me
of my children </s> <s>  joseph is no more simeon is no more
and you want to take benjamin away </s> <s>  all these things
are against me </s> <s>
reuben spoke to his father saying kill my two sons
if i don't bring him to you </s> <s>  entrust him to my care
and i will bring him to you again </s> <s>
he said my son shall not go down with you for his brother
is dead and he only is left </s> <s>  if harm happens to him along
the way in which you go then you will bring down my gray
hairs with sorrow to sheol </s> <s>
the famine was severe in the land </s> <s>
it happened when they had eaten up the grain which they had
brought out of egypt their father said to them go again
buy us a little more food </s> <s>
judah spoke to him saying the man solemnly warned us saying
'you shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.' </s> <s>
if you'll send our brother with us we'll go down and buy you food
but if you'll not send him we'll not go down for the man
said to us 'you shall not see my face unless your brother
is with you.' </s> <s>
israel said why did you treat me so badly telling the man
that you had another brother </s> <s>
they said the man asked directly concerning ourselves
and concerning our relatives saying 'is your father still alive </s> <s>
have you another brother?' </s> <s>  we just answered his questions </s> <s>
is there any way we could know that he would say
'bring your brother down?' </s> <s>
judah said to israel his father send the boy with me
and we'll get up and go so that we may live and not die
both we and you and also our little ones </s> <s>
i'll be collateral for him </s> <s>  from my hand will you require him </s> <s>
if i don't bring him to you and set him before you
then let me bear the blame forever
for if we hadn't delayed surely we would have returned a second
time by now </s> <s>
their father israel said to them if it must be so then do this </s> <s>
take from the choice fruits of the land in your bags and carry
down a present for the man a little balm a little honey
spices and myrrh nuts and almonds

the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks </s> <s>
perhaps it was an oversight </s> <s>
take your brother also get up and return to the man </s> <s>
may god almighty give you mercy before the man
that he may release to you your other brother and benjamin </s> <s>
if i am bereaved of my children i am bereaved </s> <s>
the men took that present and they took double money in

and stood before joseph </s> <s>
when joseph saw benjamin with them he said to the steward of
his house bring the men into the house and butcher an animal
and make ready for the men will dine with me at noon </s> <s>
the man did as joseph commanded and the man brought the men
to joseph's house </s> <s>
the men were afraid because they were brought to joseph's house

sacks at the first time we're brought in that he may seek
occasion against us attack us and seize us as slaves
along with our donkeys </s> <s>
they came near to the steward of joseph's house and they
spoke to him at the door of the house

to buy food </s> <s>
when we came to the lodging place we opened our sacks

our money in full weight </s> <s>  we have brought it back in our hand </s> <s>
we have brought down other money in our hand to buy food </s> <s>
we don't know who put our money in our sacks </s> <s>

i received your money </s> <s>  he brought simeon out to them </s> <s>
the man brought the men into joseph's house and gave them water

they made ready the present for joseph's coming at noon
for they heard that they should eat bread there </s> <s>
when joseph came home they brought him the present which was
in their hand into the house and bowed themselves down to him
to the earth </s> <s>
he asked them of their welfare and said is your father well
the old man of whom you spoke </s> <s>  is he yet alive </s> <s>
they said your servant our father is well </s> <s>  he is still alive </s> <s>
they bowed the head and did homage </s> <s>
he lifted up his eyes and saw benjamin his brother
his mother's son and said is this your youngest brother
of whom you spoke to me </s> <s>  he said god be gracious
to you my son </s> <s>
joseph hurried for his heart yearned over his brother
and he sought a place to weep </s> <s>  he entered into his room
and wept there </s> <s>
he washed his face and came out </s> <s>  he controlled himself
and said serve the meal </s> <s>
they served him by himself and them by themselves
and the egyptians that ate with him by themselves
because the egyptians don't eat bread with the hebrews
for that is an abomination to the egyptians </s> <s>
they sat before him the firstborn according to his birthright
and the youngest according to his youth and the men marveled
one with another </s> <s>
he sent portions to them from before him but benjamin's
portion was five times as much as any of theirs </s> <s>
they drank and were merry with him </s> <s>
he commanded the steward of his house saying fill the men's
sacks with food as much as they can carry and put every
man's money in his sack's mouth </s> <s>
put my cup the silver cup in the sack's mouth of the youngest
with his grain money </s> <s>  he did according to the word that
joseph had spoken </s> <s>
as soon as the morning was light the men were sent away
they and their donkeys </s> <s>
when they had gone out of the city and were not yet far off
joseph said to his steward up follow after the men </s> <s>
when you overtake them ask them 'why have you rewarded
evil for good </s> <s>
isn't this that from which my lord drinks and by which
he indeed divines </s> <s>  you have done evil in so doing.' </s> <s>
he overtook them and he spoke these words to them </s> <s>
they said to him why does my lord speak such words as these </s> <s>
far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing </s> <s>
behold the money which we found in our sacks' mouths we brought
again to you out of the land of canaan </s> <s>  how then should we
steal silver or gold out of your lord's house </s> <s>
with whoever of your servants it be found let him die
and we also will be my lord's bondservants </s> <s>
he said now also let it be according to your words
he with whom it is found will be my bondservant and you
will be blameless </s> <s>
then they hurried and every man took his sack down to the ground
and every man opened his sack </s> <s>
he searched beginning with the eldest and ending at the youngest </s> <s>
the cup was found in benjamin's sack </s> <s>
then they tore their clothes and every man loaded his donkey
and returned to the city </s> <s>
judah and his brothers came to joseph's house and he was
still there </s> <s>  they fell on the ground before him </s> <s>
joseph said to them what deed is this that you have done </s> <s>
don't you know that such a man as i can indeed divine </s> <s>
judah said what will we tell my lord </s> <s>  what will we speak </s> <s>
or how will we clear ourselves </s> <s>  god has found out the iniquity
of your servants </s> <s>  behold we are my lord's bondservants
both we and he also in whose hand the cup is found </s> <s>
he said far be it from me that i should do so </s> <s>  the man
in whose hand the cup is found he will be my bondservant
but as for you go up in peace to your father </s> <s>
then judah came near to him and said oh my lord
please let your servant speak a word in my lord's ears
and don't let your anger burn against your servant
for you are even as pharaoh </s> <s>
my lord asked his servants saying 'have you a father
or a brother?' </s> <s>
we said to my lord 'we have a father an old man and a child
of his old age a little one and his brother is dead
and he alone is left of his mother and his father loves him.' </s> <s>
you said to your servants 'bring him down to me that i may
set my eyes on him.' </s> <s>
we said to my lord 'the boy can't leave his father
for if he should leave his father his father would die.' </s> <s>
you said to your servants 'unless your youngest brother comes
down with you you will see my face no more.' </s> <s>
it happened when we came up to your servant my father
we told him the words of my lord </s> <s>
our father said 'go again buy us a little food.' </s> <s>
we said 'we can't go down </s> <s>  if our youngest brother is with us
then we will go down  for we may not see the man's face
unless our youngest brother is with us.' </s> <s>
your servant my father said to us 'you know that my wife
bore me two sons
and the one went out from me and i said surely he is torn
in pieces and i haven't seen him since </s> <s>
if you take this one also from me and harm happens to him
you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to sheol.' </s> <s>
now therefore when i come to your servant my father
and the boy is not with us seeing that his life is bound up
in the boy's life
it will happen when he sees that the boy is no more
that he will die </s> <s>  your servants will bring down the gray
hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to sheol </s> <s>
for your servant became collateral for the boy to my father
saying 'if i don't bring him to you then i will bear
the blame to my father forever.' </s> <s>
now therefore please let your servant stay instead of the boy
a bondservant to my lord and let the boy go up with his brothers </s> <s>
for how will i go up to my father if the boy isn't with me?-- </s> <s>
lest i see the evil that will come on my father </s> <s>
then joseph couldn't control himself before all those who stood
before him and he cried cause every man to go out from me </s> <s>
no one else stood with him while joseph made himself known
to his brothers </s> <s>
he wept aloud </s> <s>  the egyptians heard and the house of pharaoh heard </s> <s>
joseph said to his brothers i am joseph </s> <s>  does my father
still live </s> <s>  his brothers couldn't answer him for they
were terrified at his presence </s> <s>
joseph said to his brothers come near to me please </s> <s>
they came near </s> <s>  he said i am joseph your brother
whom you sold into egypt </s> <s>
now don't be grieved nor angry with yourselves that you sold
me here for god sent me before you to preserve life </s> <s>
for these two years the famine has been in the land
and there are yet five years in which there will be neither
plowing nor harvest </s> <s>
god sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth
and to save you alive by a great deliverance </s> <s>
so now it wasn't you who sent me here but god and he has
made me a father to pharaoh lord of all his house and ruler
over all the land of egypt </s> <s>
hurry and go up to my father and tell him 'this is what
your son joseph says god has made me lord of all egypt </s> <s>
come down to me </s> <s>  don't wait </s> <s>

behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother benjamin

you shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt
and of all that you have seen </s> <s>  you shall hurry and bring
my father down here </s> <s>
he fell on his brother benjamin's neck and wept and benjamin
wept on his neck </s> <s>
he kissed all his brothers and wept on them </s> <s>  after that his
brothers talked with him </s> <s>
the report of it was heard in pharaoh's house saying
joseph's brothers have come </s> <s>  it pleased pharaoh well
and his servants </s> <s>
pharaoh said to joseph tell your brothers 'do this </s> <s>
load your animals and go travel to the land of canaan </s> <s>
take your father and your households and come to me
and i will give you the good of the land of egypt and you
will eat the fat of the land.' </s> <s>
now you are commanded  do this </s> <s>  take wagons out of the land
of egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring
your father and come </s> <s>
also don't concern yourselves about your belongings
for the good of all of the land of egypt is yours </s> <s>
the sons of israel did so </s> <s>  joseph gave them wagons
according to the commandment of pharaoh and gave them
provision for the way </s> <s>
he gave each one of them changes of clothing but to benjamin he gave
three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing </s> <s>
to his father he sent after this manner  ten donkeys loaded
with the good things of egypt and ten female donkeys loaded
with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way </s> <s>
so he sent his brothers away and they departed </s> <s>
he said to them see that you don't quarrel on the way </s> <s>
they went up out of egypt and came into the land of canaan
to jacob their father </s> <s>
they told him saying joseph is still alive and he is
ruler over all the land of egypt </s> <s>  his heart fainted
for he didn't believe them </s> <s>
they told him all the words of joseph which he had said to them </s> <s>
when he saw the wagons which joseph had sent to carry him
the spirit of jacob their father revived </s> <s>
israel said it is enough </s> <s>  joseph my son is still alive </s> <s>
i will go and see him before i die </s> <s>
israel traveled with all that he had and came to beersheba

joseph made ready his chariot and went up to meet israel

israel said to joseph now let me die since i have seen
your face that you are still alive </s> <s>
joseph said to his brothers and to his father's house
i will go up and speak with pharaoh and will tell him
'my brothers and my father's house who were in the land
of canaan have come to me </s> <s>
these men are shepherds for they have been keepers of livestock

it will happen when pharaoh summons you and will say
'what is your occupation?' </s> <s>
that you shall say 'your servants have been keepers of livestock
from our youth even until now both we and our fathers'
that you may dwell in the land of goshen for every shepherd
is an abomination to the egyptians </s> <s>
then joseph went in and told pharaoh and said my father
and my brothers with their flocks their herds and all that
they own have come out of the land of canaan and behold
they are in the land of goshen </s> <s>
from among his brothers he took five men and presented
them to pharaoh </s> <s>
pharaoh said to his brothers what is your occupation </s> <s>
they said to pharaoh your servants are shepherds both we
and our fathers </s> <s>
they said to pharaoh we have come to live as foreigners in
the land for there is no pasture for your servants' flocks </s> <s>
for the famine is severe in the land of canaan </s> <s>  now therefore
please let your servants dwell in the land of goshen </s> <s>
pharaoh spoke to joseph saying your father and your brothers
have come to you </s> <s>
the land of egypt is before you </s> <s>  make your father and your
brothers dwell in the best of the land </s> <s>  let them dwell
in the land of goshen </s> <s>  if you know any able men among them
then put them in charge of my livestock </s> <s>
joseph brought in jacob his father and set him before pharaoh
and jacob blessed pharaoh </s> <s>
pharaoh said to jacob how many are the days of the years
of your life </s> <s>
jacob said to pharaoh the days of the years of my pilgrimage
are one hundred thirty years </s> <s>  few and evil have been
the days of the years of my life and they have not attained
to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days
of their pilgrimage </s> <s>
jacob blessed pharaoh and went out from the presence of pharaoh </s> <s>
joseph placed his father and his brothers and gave them
a possession in the land of egypt in the best of the land
in the land of rameses as pharaoh had commanded </s> <s>
joseph nourished his father his brothers and all of his
father's household with bread according to their families </s> <s>
there was no bread in all the land for the famine was very severe
so that the land of egypt and the land of canaan fainted
by reason of the famine </s> <s>
joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of egypt
and in the land of canaan for the grain which they bought
and joseph brought the money into pharaoh's house </s> <s>
when the money was all spent in the land of egypt and in
the land of canaan all the egyptians came to joseph and said
give us bread for why should we die in your presence </s> <s>
for our money fails </s> <s>
joseph said give me your livestock and i will give you food
for your livestock if your money is gone </s> <s>
they brought their livestock to joseph and joseph gave
them bread in exchange for the horses and for the flocks
and for the herds and for the donkeys  and he fed them
with bread in exchange for all their livestock for that year </s> <s>
when that year was ended they came to him the second year
and said to him we will not hide from my lord how our money
is all spent and the herds of livestock are my lord's </s> <s> there
is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies
and our lands </s> <s>
why should we die before your eyes both we and our land </s> <s>
buy us and our land for bread and we and our land will
be servants to pharaoh </s> <s>  give us seed that we may live
and not die and that the land won't be desolate </s> <s>
so joseph bought all the land of egypt for pharaoh
for the egyptians sold every man his field because the famine
was severe on them and the land became pharaoh's </s> <s>
as for the people he moved them to the cities from one end
of the border of egypt even to the other end of it </s> <s>
only he didn't buy the land of the priests for the priests had a
portion from pharaoh and ate their portion which pharaoh gave them </s> <s>
that is why they didn't sell their land </s> <s>
then joseph said to the people behold i have bought you
and your land today for pharaoh </s> <s>  behold here is seed for you
and you shall sow the land </s> <s>
it will happen at the harvests that you shall give a fifth
to pharaoh and four parts will be your own for seed
of the field for your food for them of your households
and for food for your little ones </s> <s>
they said you have saved our lives </s> <s>  let us find favor
in the sight of my lord and we will be pharaoh's servants </s> <s>
joseph made it a statute concerning the land of egypt
to this day that pharaoh should have the fifth </s> <s>
only the land of the priests alone didn't become pharaoh's </s> <s>
israel lived in the land of egypt in the land of goshen
and they got themselves possessions therein and were fruitful
and multiplied exceedingly </s> <s>
jacob lived in the land of egypt seventeen years </s> <s>
so the days of jacob the years of his life were one
hundred forty-seven years </s> <s>
the time drew near that israel must die and he called his son joseph
and said to him if now i have found favor in your sight please put
your hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me </s> <s>
please don't bury me in egypt
but when i sleep with my fathers you shall carry me
out of egypt and bury me in their burying place </s> <s>
he said i will do as you have said </s> <s>
he said swear to me and he swore to him </s> <s>  israel bowed
himself on the bed's head </s> <s>
it happened after these things that someone said to joseph behold
your father is sick </s> <s>  he took with him his two sons
