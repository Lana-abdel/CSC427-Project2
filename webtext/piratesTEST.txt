[they start digging under where Elizabeth was sitting]
[Pintel and Ragetti are by the boat, clowning around, Ragetti is balancing a shovel on one hand]
PINTEL: "Mind the tide." 
RAGETTI: I can/may join the circus!
PINTEL: Don't mind if I shine your shoes, Sir?
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
[Jones is watching Pintel and Ragetti on the beach through a spyglass]
DAVY JONES: They're here. And I cannot step foot on land again for near of a decade. 
MACCUS: Then trust us to act in your stead.
DAVY JONES: I'll trust you know what awaits should you *fail*! Down, then!
[ugly, nondescript crewmember] Down!
MACCUS: Down!
[view from the deck of the Flying Dutchman as it submerges, some underwater footage]
[Pintel and Ragetti are astounded to see the ship submerge in the distance, Ragetti's balanced shovel falls]
[Pintel and Ragetti run off to warn the others]
Scene: ###!
ISLA CRUCES: beach
[Norrington is digging in the sand, Jack sits in a lotus position nearby on a sandy slope] 
[while digging, Norrington's shovel hits something hard, they brush off sand to reveal a chest]
[they remove the chest from the sand]
[the chest contains a pearl necklace, documents, and a smaller chest, among other things]
[Elizabeth opens up a letter with a wax seal, and reads it to herself]
[they all bend near to put their ears to the small chest, and they hear a heartbeat]
ELIZABETH SWANN: It's real!
NORRINGTON: You actually *were* telling the truth.
JACK SPARROW: I do that quite a lot. Yet people are always surprised.
WILL TURNER: With good reason!
[Will has unexpectedly appeared on the beach, walking up toward them] 
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will! You're alright! Thank God! I came to find you!
[Will and Elizabeth kiss]
JACK SPARROW: How did you get here?
WILL TURNER: Sea turtles, mate. A pair of them, strapped to my feet.
JACK SPARROW: Not so easy, is it?
WILL TURNER: But I do owe you thanks, Jack.
JACK SPARROW: You do?
WILL TURNER: After you tricked me onto that ship to square your debt with Jones.
ELIZABETH SWANN: What?
JACK SPARROW: What?
WILL TURNER: I was reunited with my father.
JACK SPARROW: Oh! Well... you're welcome, then.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Everything you said to me... every word, was a lie!
JACK SPARROW: Pretty much. Time and tide, love. 
[Will stoops down with the key to open the chest]
JACK SPARROW: Oy! What're you doing?
WILL TURNER: I'm gonna kill Jones.
[Jack draws his sword, points it at Will]
JACK SPARROW: Can't let you do that, William. 'Cause if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now. If you please: The key.
[Will backs up slowly, then suddenly draws Elizabeth's sword, points it at Jack]
WILL TURNER: I keep the promises I make, Jack. I intend to free my father. I hope you're here to see it.
[Norrington draws his sword, points it at Will]
NORRINGTON: I can't let you do that, either. So sorry.
JACK SPARROW: I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.
[Norrington points his sword at Jack]
NORRINGTON: Lord Beckett desires the contents of that chest. I deliver it, and get my life back.
JACK SPARROW: Ah. The dark side of ambition.
NORRINGTON: Oh, I prefer to see it as the promise of redemption.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Stop it! Be careful!
[various dueling interjections]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Jack!
WILL TURNER: Guard the chest!
[duel halts for a second]
ELIZABETH SWANN: *No*!
[duel resumes]
ELIZABETH SWANN: This is bar-*baric*! This is *no* way for grown men to settle - ! Oh! Fine! Let's just - *pull* out our swords and start *banging* away at each other! *This will solve everything!* I've had it! I've had enough! Wobbly-legged, rum-soaked... *pirates*! 
[Elizabeth throws a rock at the duelists, but the rock goes far to the left of them]
PINTEL: How'd this go all screwy? Enough!
RAGETTI: Well, each wants the chest for hisself, don't 'e? Mister Norrington, I think he's tryna regain a bit of honor. Old Jack's lookin' to trade it, save his own skin. And Turner there - I figure 'e's tryna... settle some unresolved business 'twixt him and his twice-cursed pirate father. 
PINTEL: Sad. That chest must be worth more 'n a shiny penny. 
RAGETTI: Oh! Tsk-tsk-tsk. Terrible temptation.
PINTEL: If we was any kind of *decent*, we'd remove temptation from their path.
[Pintel and Ragetti giggle and run off to steal the small chest]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will! *Enough!*
[Elizabeth is panting from exasperation and exhaustion]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh! Oh...! The heat!
[Elizabeth pretends to faint, which knocks off her hat]
[Elizabeth watches sideways as the duelists continue fighting, oblivious to her]
[Elizabeth soon sits up, puts on her hat]
[Pintel & Ragetti run by in the distance behind her, with the chest]
[Elizabeth sees Pintel & Ragetti, and goes to chase them]
[various duel scenes on the beach]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Bugger!
[Norrington kicks sand in Will's face]
NORRINGTON: By your leave, Mister Turner.
[Norrington runs off to chase Jack up the hill]
[the crew of Flying Dutchman emerge from the shallows]
[one crewmember holds chain shot as a weapon]
ISLA CRUCES: church
[Jack and Norrington run through bushes on the beach, then up to a dilapidated stone church on the hill] [P2] 
[Norrington chases Jack up steps inside the building, Jack kicks Norrington back down with his foot] 
[Jack and Norrington have a swordfight on the inside steps]
[Jack grabs hold of the bell rope, which carries him downward, and carries Will upward, who just arrived]
WILL TURNER: By *your* leave, Mister Norrington.
[the Flying Dutchman crew on shore are at the large chest and look up to the ringing bell in the building on the hill]
[while Norrington and Will are dueling on top of the roof, Jack deftly grabs the dangling key away from Norrington's hand]
[noticing the key gone, Norrington then turns and duels with Jack]
[soon Norrington knocks Jack's sword from Jack's hand, the sword is flung onto the ground below]
NORRINGTON: Do excuse me while I kill the man who ruined my life.
WILL TURNER: Be my guest.
JACK SPARROW: Let us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it, who at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to *free* said pirate, and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, hey? So who's fault is it, *really*, that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates?
NORRINGTON: Enough!
[Jack somersaults off the roof to escape, Norrington turns to Will]
NORRINGTON: Unfortunately, Mister Turner... He's *right*!
[Norrington and Will resume their part of the rooftop duel]
JACK SPARROW: Still rooting for you, mate!
[Jack picks up his sword from the ground, and puts the key around his neck]
[Jack walks through a graveyard, falls into an open grave] 
JACK SPARROW: Wup!
[Jack stands up in the bottom of the hole]
JACK SPARROW: Oh.
[Norrington backs Will onto the top of the mill's waterwheel]
[the axle of the wheel breaks off with Norrington and Jack dueling on top]
[Jack is facing the other direction, so is unaware of the freed wheel rolling behind him]
[the wheel crashes through a small fence, turns, and rolls directly towards Jack]
[the waterwheel rolls over Jack, and Jack is pulled into the inside of the wheel]
JACK SPARROW: Woah!
[the key that Jack had around his neck falls off into the wheel]
[Jack struggles to grab the key, which is caught and dangling inside the rolling wheel]
[Jack finally grabs the key, but hits his head on a metal bar inside the wheel, and falls off the wheel] 
[Pintel & Ragetti are running off with the small chest, each holding one side, giggling]
[Elizabeth steps in front Pintel & Ragetti, confronting them, halts, panting]
[Pintel & Ragetti drop the chest, pull their swords on Elizabeth]
[Elizabeth reaches for her sword, but it's gone] 
PINTEL: 'Ello, Poppet.
[Pintel & Ragetti slowly advance on Elizabeth, she slowly retreats while facing them]
[they all pause for a moment to watch the wheel roll by with the duel on top]
[Jack is running behind the wheel, trying to catch up and get the key that is still inside]
[Pintel shrugs, Pintel and Ragetti resume advancing on Elizabeth]
[suddenly a thrown axe embeds itself in a coconut palm next to Elizabeth]
[all three turn to see Jones' crew crashing through the bushes toward them]
[swordfight ensues with the Flying Dutchmen crew and Pintel and Ragetti]
[Norrington and Will continue fighting atop the rolling wheel]
[Jack grabs hold of a palm frond on a coconut palm while at the top of the wheel]
[the wheel continues on, Jack hangs from the frond, then drops to the ground]
PINTEL: Sword!
ELIZABETH SWANN: Sword!
[a sword is thrown to Elizabeth, just in time]
PINTEL: Sword!
[a sword is thrown to Pintel, just in time]
RAGETTI: Sword!
[a sword is thrown to Ragetti, just in time]
[Jack sees Hadrus running alone through the palms, carrying the small chest]
[Jack picks up a coconut, whirls it a moment, then throws it at Hadrus]
[Hadrus' (conch shell) head is knocked off by the coconut]
[Hadrus' head lies on the ground, attempting to give orders to the rest of his body to find the head]
HADRUS: Aya! Uh seech! Aunido! Aunido! Follow my voice! Follow my voice! To the left, uh... No, to the right... Go to the left... 
[Hadrus' headless body walks into a coconut palm]
HADRUS: No... That's a tree.
JACK SPARROW: Oh, shut it.
[Jack unlocks the small chest with the key, square security bolts suddenly protrude when opened]
[the heart is inside, beating]
[crewmen of the Flying Dutchman approach, Jack tucks the heart into his vest]
[Elizabeth uses two swords together, one in each hand, to stab backwards and kill two attacking crewmen]
ISLA CRUCES: beach
[Jack is the first to arrive back at the longboat on the beach]
JACK SPARROW: Jar of dirt!
[Jack opens his jar of dirt, dumps out some dirt, puts the heart in the jar, scoops handfuls of dirt back into the jar]
[a Flying Dutchman crewmember arrives at the boat, Jack fights him using an oar]
[the swordfight is carried to the beach as the Black Pearl crew attempts to escape by longboat]
[Norrington arrives at the longboat, while others are fighting he takes the heart from the jar, puts it under his vest]
[the rolling waterwheel reaches the beach, rolls out into the shallows, falls on its side]
[Norrington and Will walk away from it, wobbling from dizziness]
WILL TURNER: Right!
[Pintel & Ragetti attempt to escape by longboat, but Will blocks their progress]
[Pintel & Ragetti reach for their swords, to find their swords gone]
[Pintel & Ragetti grab a fishnet and oar as weapons against Will]
PINTEL: Come on, Turner!
[Jack fights with Koleniko, using an oar, subdues him]
[Will sees the key in the chest, Jack notices Will looking at the key and chest]
[Jack hits Will on the head with the our, which knocks him out]
JACK SPARROW: Leave him lie! Unless you plan on using him to hit something with.
ELIZABETH SWANN: We're not getting out of this.
NORRINGTON: Not with the chest. Into the boat. 
[Norrington takes the chest]
ELIZABETH SWANN: You're mad.
NORRINGTON: Don't wait for me.
JACK SPARROW: Uh, I say we respect his final wish.
PINTEL: Aye! 
[the remaining Black Pearl crew escape by longboat]
[Hadrus is holding his conch shell head under one arm, the head speaks to Norrington]
HADRUS: Your bravery is wasted. I shall pry the chest away from your cold... dead... hands.
[Norrington pauses, looks around]
NORRINGTON: Here you go! 
HADRUS: Oo!
[Norrington flees, Hadrus drops his head onto the ground when catching the chest]
[Hadrus' crewmates laugh and walk off with Hadrus' body, ignoring Hadrus' head]
HADRUS: Uh! Ando! Aunido! Aunido! Pirates!
[the face inside Hadrus' head turns around, turns into a hermit crab, extends its legs]
[the hermit crab head crawls after its departing body and crew]
HADRUS: Vengo kowmpenay lachay. Hey! Hovaya! Black Pearl
[Will, lying flat on the deck, head over a grate, returns to consciousness aboard the Black Pearl]
WILL TURNER: What happened to the chest?
ELIZABETH SWANN: Norrington took it to draw them off.
PINTEL: You're pulling too hard!
RAGETTI: You're not pulling hard enough!
GIBBS: Where's the Commodore?
JACK SPARROW: He fell behind.
GIBBS: My prayers be with him. Best not wallow in our grief. The bright side is: You're back. And made it off free and clear.
[the Flying Dutchman suddenly surfaces alongside them]
GIBBS: Lord almighty.us.
JACK SPARROW: I'll handle this, mate.
JACK SPARROW: Hey! Fishface! Lose something? Hey? Oup!
[Jack falls down the stairs of the Pearl, crew says "Ooh!"]
JACK SPARROW: Got it! 
[Jack stands up, struts across the deck, holding his jar of dirt]
JACK SPARROW: Come to negotiate, eh, have you, you slimy git? Look what I got. I got a jar of dirt! I got a jar of dirt! And guess what's inside it?
DAVY JONES: Enough!
[the Flying Dutchman's cannon covers slide down, cannons emerge from the holes]
JACK SPARROW: Hard to starboard.
ELIZABETH SWANN: *Hard to starboard!*
WILL TURNER: Brace up the foreyard! 
GIBBS: Hard to starboard!
DAVY JONES: Send his beloved Pearl back to the depths! Fire!
[a heavy cannonade fires from the Flying Dutchman, blowing large holes in the Black Pearl]
[Pintel and Ragetti look through the gaping hole in the stern, see the Flying Dutchman following them]
PINTEL: She's on us! She's on us!
DAVY JONES: Let them taste the triple guns.
[cage-faced crewmember] Aye, Captain.
[triple-barreled cannon fires, barrel rotates after each blast] 
DAVY JONES: Come on, ###!
ELIZABETH SWANN: She's falling behind!
GIBBS: Aye, and we've got her!
WILL TURNER: We're the faster?
GIBBS: Against the wind the Dutchman beats us. That's how she takes her prey. But *with* the wind...
WILL TURNER: We rob her advantage.
GIBBS: Ah!
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
DAVY JONES: They're out of range! Break out run ### We giving up, Sir?
[crewmen of the Flying Dutchman are whipped to raise the Kraken calling device]
Scene: BLACK PEARL
MARTY: They're giving up! Yay!
[crew cheers]
WILL TURNER: My father is *on* that ship. If we can outrun her, we can take her. We should turn and fight. 
JACK SPARROW: Why fight when you can negotiate? All one needs... is the proper leverage.
[suddenly the Black Pearl is badly jarred]
[Jack's jar of dirt falls to the deck, breaks open, spills all the dirt]
[Jack runs down to the spilled dirt, searches frantically for the heart, which is gone]
JACK SPARROW: Where is it? Where is the thump-thump? We must've hit the reef! 
WILL TURNER: No. It's not a reef! Get away from the rail!
ELIZABETH SWANN: What is it?
WILL TURNER: The Kraken. To arms!
GIBBS: All guns, defend the masts! 
WILL TURNER: It'll attack the starboard. I've seen it before. Break out the cannons and hold for my signal. 
[with a deep rumbling sound, the Kraken's tentacles slowly crawl up the hull]
WILL TURNER: Easy, boys!
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will?
[the tentacles rise higher]
WILL TURNER: Steady! Steady.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will?
[the tentacles start feeling around the ship]
WILL TURNER: Hold. Hold...
PINTEL: I think we've held fire long enough.
ELIZABETH SWANN: *Will?*
WILL TURNER: *Fire...*!
[the crew fire the cannons, hitting the tentacles and nearly severing some]
[the Kraken sinks into the sea, some tentacles glowing from the blast]
[the crew cheers]
WILL TURNER: It'll be back. We have to get off the ship.
ELIZABETH SWANN: There's no boats.
[Will sees the wrecked boats, then sets his eyes on the barrels of gunpowder]
WILL TURNER: Pull the grates! Get all the gunpowder onto the net in the cargo hold.
[hands Elizabeth a long gun]
WILL TURNER: Whatever you do, don't miss.
ELIZABETH SWANN: As soon as you're clear.
[the crew is busy loading barrels of gunpowder from the hold] We are short stocked on gunpowder. Six barrel/below.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Bring it up!
GIBBS: There's only half a dozen kegs of powder!
WILL TURNER: Then load the rum!
[Gibbs seems shocked, then turns to see the entire crew halted, staring at him in shocked silence]
GIBBS: Aye! The rum, too!
[the crew continues loading]
[aerial view approaching Black Pearl, zooming through the rigging to the other side]
[Jack is in a rowboat alone, rowing away from the Black Pearl]
[Jack stops rowing, sees the Kraken with tentacles around Black Pearl in the distance]
[Jack looks back into the direction he's headed, then consults his Compass]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Step to!
[Elizabeth runs to the railing, sees Jack rowing away]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh you coward!
[another heavy thud hits the ship, crewmen shout]
MARTY: Not good.
[the Kraken attacks again]
WILL TURNER: Pull away!
GIBBS: Heave! Heave like you're being paid for it!
[Pintel & Ragetti stand to one side of a cannon port as a tentacle pulls one crewmember through sideways]
[Will hangs onto the side of the net of gunpowder barrels, attempting to attract the Kraken's attention]
WILL TURNER: Euh! Come on!I'm over here! Come on!
[Will slashes at tentacles with his sword]
WILL TURNER: Shoot! Elizabeth, shoot!
[Elizabeth hesitates, waiting for Will to fall free]
[one of the Kraken's tentacles wrap around her leg and drag her backwards, she screams]
[Ragetti chops off the end of the tentacle holding Elizabeth]
[Another crewmember picks up the rifle and attempts to shoot, only to be grabbed by the Kraken and flung around]
[the rifle drops onto the deck above Elizabeth]
[Elizabeth tries to pick up the fallen rifle, but someone's foot holds it down]
[she sees that it's Jack's foot, that he has returned to the Pearl]
[Jack picks up the rifle and takes aim at the gunpowder]
[slow motion scene of Jack firing a ball into the gunpowder]
[ball whistles through the air, strikes the gunpowder, which explodes]
[the Kraken releases its hold, burned tentacles withdraw into the ocean, groaning sound]
MARTY: Did we kill it?
GIBBS: No. We just made it angry. We're not out of this yet. Captain! Orders!
JACK SPARROW: Abandon ship. Into the longboat.
GIBBS: Jack! The Pearl!
JACK SPARROW: She's only a ship, mate.
ELIZABETH SWANN: He's right, we have to head for land.
PINTEL: 'S a lot o' open wa'er.
RAGETTI: That's a lot o' wa'er.
WILL TURNER: We have to try. We can get away as it takes down the Pearl.
GIBBS: Abandon ship. Abandon ship or abandon hope.
[the crew get ready to leave the Pearl, loading supplies and guns]
[Elizabeth approaches Jack]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Thank you, Jack.
JACK SPARROW: We're not free yet, love.
ELIZABETH SWANN: You came back. I always knew you were a good man.
[Elizabeth passionately kisses Jack] 
[Will sees the kiss from the longboat, falters]
GIBBS: Prepare to cast off! There's no time to lose! Come on, Will, step to!
[the kiss is inturrupted by the sound of shackles, Elizabeth has chained Jack to the main mast]
ELIZABETH SWANN: It's after you, not the ship. It's not us. This is the only way, don't you see? I'm not sorry.
[Elizabeth leans in as if to kiss him again.]
JACK SPARROW: Pirate. 
[Elizabeth leaves Jack and climbs down into the long boat]
WILL TURNER: Where's Jack?
ELIZABETH SWANN: He elected to stay behind to give us a chance.
[the crew look uncertain]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Go!
[the longboat casts off]
[Jack struggles with his manacles]
JACK SPARROW: Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger...!
[a coconut and cannonball roll by, on the tilted deck]
[Jack spots a fallen lantern, picks it up with the tip of his sword]
[Jack breaks the lantern against the mast, pours oil over his wrists]
[Jack struggles with slipping his hand out]
JACK SPARROW: Come on... Come on...
[Jack finally manages to slip his hands out]
[the Kraken rises up behind him]
[Jack halts, turns around, faces the Kraken]
[music and sound stop momentarily]
[the Kraken roars, spraying Jack with slime and flinging his earlier-eaten hat to the deck]
JACK SPARROW: Not so bad.
[Jack spots his old hat lying next to his feet]
JACK SPARROW: Oh!
[Jack spots his hat, picks it up, puts it on, wipes slime from his face]
JACK SPARROW: Hello, beastie.
[slow motion scene of Jack boldy charging toward the Kraken's mouth, sword drawn] [Q3] 
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
DAVY JONES: Jack Sparrow. Our debt is settled. 
KOLENIKO: The captain goes down with his ship.
MACCUS: Turns out not even Jack Sparrow can best the devil.
DAVY JONES: Open the chest. Open the chest, I need to see it!
[the chest is opened, side view as Jones looks in, his face quivers]
[downwards view, showing that the chest is empty, Jones tilts his head back and shouts]
DAVY JONES: Damn you, Jack Spar-*row*!
PORT ROYAL: EITC headquarters
MERCER: The last of our ships has returned.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Is there any news on the chest?
MERCER: None. But... one of the ships did pick up a man adrift at sea. He had these.
[Mercer drops the Letters of Marque on Beckett's desk]
[Beckett opens the letter to look at it before looking up at Norrington, who has been standing in the office] 
NORRINGTON: I took the liberty of filling in my name.
[from his desk, Beckett beckons Norrington with two fingers]
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: If you intend to claim these, then you must have something to trade. D'you have the Compass?
NORRINGTON: Better. The heart of Davy Jones.
BAYOU: Tia's shack
[the remaining crew paddles through the waters to Tia Dalma's shack] 
[many natives stand in the waters surrounding the shack, holding candles, mourning Jack Sparrow]
[inside the shack, Will absent-mindedly keeps throwing his father's knife into the table top]
[Tia carries a tray around to all of them, offers the mugs to Elizabeth]
TIA DALMA: Against de cold... and de sorrow.
[Elizabeth takes a mug but doesn't drink] 
TIA DALMA: It's a shame. I know you're t'inking that wid the Pearl, you coulda captured the devil and set free your fadder's soul.
WILL TURNER: Doesn't matter now. The Pearl's gone. Along with its captain.
[Gibbs is standing in the doorway on the side of the shack]
GIBBS: Aye. And already the world seems a bit less bright. He fooled us all right to the end. But I guess that honest streak finally won out. To Jack Sparrow!
RAGETTI: Never another like Captain Jack.
PINTEL: He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.
ELIZABETH SWANN: He was a good man.
[they all take a drink out of their mugs, except Elizabeth]
WILL TURNER: If there was anything could be done to bring him back... Elizabeth...
TIA DALMA: Would you do it? Hmmm? What... would you? Hmmm? What would *any* of you be willing to do? Hmmm? Would you sail to the ends of the eart', and beyond, to fetch back witty Jack and 'im precious Pearl? 
GIBBS: Aye.
PINTEL: Aye.
RAGETTI: Aye.
COTTON'S PARROT: Awk! Aye.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Yes.
WILL TURNER: Aye.
TIA DALMA: Alright. But if you're goin' brave de weird, and haunted shores, at world's end, den... you will need a captain who knows dose waters. 
[a man wearing boots descends the stairs into the room]
BARBOSSA: So tell me, what's become of my ship? 
[Barbossa bites into a green apple, juice dripples down his chin]
[Jack the monkey on Barbossa's left shoulder faces the camera and snarls]
